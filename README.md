# Creative Coding

_Experimental / Still under construction_
 
This repo is an experimental one. 
It is an UI for diy particle art, where the user can adjust values with no code needed.
This is in the works for one of my clients whom is an incredible artist which would like to add digital art in her portfolio.

Currently there are 2 templates:
- Simple Grid where it draw a grid with dynamic amount of cells
- Freauency Grid where it takes 3D or 2 noise and have lines move according to the frequency dynamically set by the user

All grids have dynamic basic values, such as number of rows/columns, background colour and line tickness.

This project is using [Canvas Sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch), [Canvas Sketch Util](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch-util) and [Tweakpane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane) as dependencies.

The physics and the rendering logic are manually calculated.
